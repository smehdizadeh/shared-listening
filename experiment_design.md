# Experiment design #

*This protocol has been submitted to the University of Colorado Boulder Institutional Review Board (IRB) and is pending review.*

### Overview ###

The procedures and tasks in this study are largely adapted from a recent study by [Curzel et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109964), who developed a novel experimental paradigm for simulated music sharing. This proposed work aims to expand on the findings of Curzel et al. (2024) to ask the following research questions: 
1)	How do social versus non-social music listening contexts influence adolescents’ subjective experiences of music, and their subsequent prosocial behaviors? 
2)	How do different types of music reward influence individuals’ subjective experiences of music, and their subsequent prosocial behaviors? 
3)	How do individual differences, or trait characteristics, interact with individuals’ subjective experiences during music listening and/or individuals’ prosocial outcomes?

### About the participants ###

- We plan to recruit **140 participants** for this study. According to our calculations, this would allow for a statistical power of 0.8 with &alpha; = 0.05 and a small-medium anticipated effect size (from Curzel et al., 2024).
- **Participants will be 18-25** ("late adolescence")[^1].
- Participants will be recruited from the Boulder, Colorado community.
- Participants will receive monetary compensation for their participation, identical in amount to Curzel et al. (2024).

### Procedures ###

#### Part 1: Online survey ####

Participants will receive an [online survey](/surveys/part_1_survey_questions.md) via email, which they may complete wherever they have access to a computer. The survey is a synthesis of several standard questionnaires, as well as questions asking participants to list examples of their favorite pieces of music according to specific prompts targeting two different types of music reward: structural (e.g., “songs that make you want to move or sing/hum along”), and self-relevant reward (e.g., “songs that have a personal meaning to you”). We will select a subset of these songs for participants to listen to during Part 2, allowing us to empirically test two types of rewarding music listening experience.

#### Part 2: Music-listening session ####

In the original study, there are two music conditions: participant-selected favorite and experimenter-selected music. In this study, **we propose expanding the music conditions as follows,** in order to ask further questions about the multidimensional properties of music reward and music sharing:

Instead of having two music conditions as in the original study (participant-selected favorite or experimenter-selected music), this study proposes the **following four music conditions:**
