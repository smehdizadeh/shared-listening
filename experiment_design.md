*This protocol has been submitted to the University of Colorado Boulder Institutional Review Board (IRB) and is pending review.*

---

### At a glance ###

- This is a *behavioral only* human-subjects research experiment.
- This study implements a *within-subjects* experimental design.
- This study tests 2 "listening conditions" (non-social versus social music listening contexts) by 4 "music conditions" (2 participant-selected conditions + 2 experimenter-selected conditions).

### Overview ###

The procedures and tasks in this study are largely adapted from a recent study by [Curzel et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109964), who developed a novel experimental paradigm for simulated music sharing. This proposed work aims to expand on the findings of Curzel et al. (2024) to ask the following research questions: 
1)	How do social versus non-social music listening contexts influence adolescents‚Äô subjective experiences of music, and their subsequent prosocial behaviors? 
2)	How do different types of music reward influence individuals‚Äô subjective experiences of music, and their subsequent prosocial behaviors? 
3)	How do individual differences, or trait characteristics, interact with individuals‚Äô subjective experiences during music listening and/or individuals‚Äô prosocial outcomes?

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è About the participants ###

- We plan to recruit **140 participants** for this study. According to our calculations, this would allow for a statistical power of 0.8 with &alpha; = 0.05 and a small-medium anticipated effect size (from Curzel et al., 2024).
- **Participants will be 18-25** ("late adolescents")[^1].
- Participants will be recruited from the Boulder, Colorado community.
- Participants will receive monetary compensation for their participation, identical in amount to Curzel et al. (2024).

### üë£ Procedures ###

#### üìÉ Part 1: Online survey ####

Participants will receive an [online survey](/surveys/part_1_survey_questions.md) via email, which they may complete wherever they have access to a computer. The survey is a synthesis of several standard questionnaires, as well as questions asking participants to list examples of their favorite pieces of music according to specific prompts targeting two different types of music appreciation: **structural** (e.g., ‚Äúsongs that make you want to move or sing/hum along‚Äù), and **self-relevant** (e.g., ‚Äúsongs that have a personal meaning to you‚Äù). We will select a subset of these songs for participants to listen to during Part 2, allowing us to empirically test two types of rewarding music listening experience. Trait characteristics and reported musical experience from the questionnaires will be tested as predictors in linear mixed models of participants‚Äô subjective experiences during music listening and prosocial outcomes.

#### üéß Part 2: Music-listening session ####

After completing Part 1, participants will complete an in-person behavioral task on a computer in the lab. As in [Curzel et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109964), participants will believe they are participating in a multi-site research study, and that they will be virtually connected with other participants during the experiment. In reality, other research "participants" and interactions are *simulated* via avatars, animations, and pre-programmed computer responses. During each trial, participants will "join" a "virtual room" that is either empty, or contains a small number of "other participants" (similar to the "non-social" and "social" listening conditions implemented in Curzel et al. 2024), and listen to a full-length piece of music. Implementing this simulated music sharing paradigm in this study will allow us to test this paradigm in a lab/in-person setting (instead of completely online), as well as with adolescents (our population of interest).

In Curzel et al.'s (2024) study, there are two music conditions: participant-selected favorite and experimenter-selected music. In this study, **we propose expanding the music conditions** in order to ask further questions about the multidimensional properties of music reward and music sharing. Participant-selected favorite music will be further subdivided into two music conditions: structural and self-relevant appreciation (following the survey prompts in Part 1). Experimenter-selected music will also be further subdivided into two music conditions: music which participants believe was another study participant's "self-relevant" favorite song, and music which participants believe was selected by a *non-human* agent (i.e., computer algorithm). In reality, this music will be chosen by the researchers and matched stylistically to participants' chosen music, following similar methods to Curzel et al. (2024). This allows us to ask additional questions about music listening contexts that may be more "social" not just from the *number* of people who are listening, but also the *source* of music being shared.
