### About the study ###

Music is a historically and evolutionarily important and ubiquitous part of human culture. In recent years, music technologies such as streaming services continue to increase the accessibility and prevalence of music in our everyday lives. These music listening experiences can be highly rewarding, and recent research has produced growing evidence of music as a powerful secondary reward, akin to other, more studied, stimuli such as money, or positive social cues. Indeed, research has shown that music can be employed as a motivational tool and positive reinforcer, and rewarding music listening experiences may also positively influence prosocial behaviors. Such findings would be particularly fascinating to consider in the context of adolescence, as this is both a critical period of musical engagement and social skill acquisition.

However, music reward is complex and multifaceted, and much is still unknown about how different types of rewarding music listening experiences might affect behavior. While several multidimensional frameworks of music reward have been proposed in the literature, few research studies have implemented the nuanced designs necessary to investigate differential effects of these proposed mechanisms.

This repository describes and documents our proposed behavioral human subjects research design, which both attempts to account for multidimensional properties of music reward and focuses on the late adolescent population.
