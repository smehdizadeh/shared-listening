### Your favorite music ###

Take a moment to think about the **music that you love**. Try to think about specific examples of songs that you love and **reflect on why you love them**.

For example: *I love the song Mr. Brightside by The Killers because it makes me want to jump around and sing along. I love the song Rolling in the Deep by Adele because of its intense emotion. I love the song Just Dance by Lady Gaga because every time I listen to it, it reminds me of a fun party I went to with my friends.*

The next section will ask you to create **two different lists** of songs which you love for **two different reasons**. You may be able to think of songs that fit into both categories, but **please do not repeat songs across the two lists**. <u>Try to think of songs that fit more into one category or the other.</u>

You may use your phone/computer to help you complete the lists, but please make sure you follow the corresponding prompt when making your selections.

**For the first list, think of songs that make you want to move or sing/hum along.** Movement can include tapping your foot, bobbing your head, swaying, dancing, jumping, moshing, or anything in between.

**For the second list, think of songs that have a personal meaning to you and/or that you feel you can use to express yourself.**

Please select an answer before continuing:
- [ ] Yes, the instructions are clear and I feel comfortable proceeding to create my lists.
- [ ] No, I have some follow up questions. I need to reach out to the researcher before continuing.

*(Survey only proceeds to following section if participant selects "YES")*
